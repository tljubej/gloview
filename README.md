A better macOS Mission Control-style overview plugin for Hyprland

## Install

Via hyprpm:

```sh
hyprpm add https://github.com/fedsfarm/gloview
hyprpm enable gloview
```

### Arch (AUR)

```sh
yay -S gloview
```

### Nixos

```nix
inputs.gloview = { url = "github:fedsfarm/gloview"; inputs.hyprland.follows = "hyprland"; };
```
```nix
wayland.windowManager.hyprland = {
  enable = true;
  plugins = [ inputs.gloview.packages.${pkgs.system}.gloview ];
  settings.bind = [ "SUPER, TAB, gloview:toggle" ];
};
```

## Manual build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

Produces `build/gloview.so`. The ABI must match the running Hyprland exactly —
build against the same headers, or a version skew gives a `.so` that crashes on
load. While iterating, `cmake --build build --target reload` rebuilds and
hot-reloads into the running Hyprland.

## Usage

Dispatchers: `gloview:toggle`, `gloview:open`, `gloview:close`, `gloview:desktop`,
`gloview:allworkspaces` (the all-workspaces "expo" view — opens into it if closed)
Or `hyprctl gloview` / `gloviewclose` / `gloviewdesktop` / `gloviewall`

Workspace navigation: `gloview:next`, `gloview:prev`, `gloview:setworkspace <id>`
(or `hyprctl gloviewnext` / `gloviewprev`). **Inside** the overview they behave like
`tab` and the scroll wheel: they move the *displayed* workspace and commit it to the
live desktop on close. **Outside** it they switch the live desktop right away, walking
the same ordered list the strip shows — so one pair of binds drives workspaces
everywhere. With `dynamic_workspaces` on, stepping past the last populated workspace
lands you on a fresh empty one and the workspace you left behind is reaped if you
emptied it (`gloview:setworkspace` never creates; it only switches to a workspace that
already exists on the monitor).

Strip cards: clicking a card that has windows on it shows that workspace in the main
area (the live desktop follows on close). Clicking an **empty** card — the trailing one
`dynamic_workspaces` adds, or any listed empty workspace — switches to it and closes the
overview: there is nothing on it to pick, so the click means "take me there".

Lua:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + TAB", hl.plugin.gloview.toggle)
hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + TAB", hl.plugin.gloview.desktop)
hl.bind("SUPER + CTRL + TAB", hl.plugin.gloview.allworkspaces)

hl.bind("SUPER + bracketright", hl.plugin.gloview.next)
hl.bind("SUPER + bracketleft", hl.plugin.gloview.prev)
hl.bind("SUPER + 2", function() hl.plugin.gloview.setworkspace(2) end)
```

```ini
bind = SUPER, TAB, gloview:toggle
bind = SUPER SHIFT, TAB, gloview:desktop
bind = SUPER CTRL, TAB, gloview:allworkspaces

bind = SUPER, bracketright, gloview:next
bind = SUPER, bracketleft, gloview:prev
bind = SUPER, 2, gloview:setworkspace, 2
```

## Config

All keys live under `plugin:gloview:*`. Colors are `0xAARRGGBB` integers.

- **`rows`** (default) — macOS-like: previews keep their aspect ratio and are packed into balanced rows, with the row count chosen to make the previews as large as possible. Reads spatially like the real desktop.
- **`grid`** — uniform cells, one preview centered in each.
- **`natural`** — keeps each window's real on-screen position, uniformly scaling the whole arrangement to fit.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `layout` | `rows` \| `grid` \| `natural` | `rows` | Main-area preview layout engine |
| `gap` | int (px) | `34` | Min spacing between window previews |
| `padding` | int (px) | `80` | Left/right outer margin of the preview area |
| `padding_top` | int (px) | `40` | Extra gap between the strip and the previews |
| `padding_bottom` | int (px) | `70` | Bottom outer margin |
| `max_scale` | float | `1.0` | Never enlarge a preview past real size × this |
| `preview_filter` | `box4` \| `box16` \| `linear` | `box4` | Scale-aware GPU downsampling for reduced previews: `box4` uses a 2×2 kernel, `box16` uses a smoother but costlier 4×4 kernel, and `linear` restores Hyprland's normal single-sample path |
| `duration` | int (ms) | `360` | Open/close animation length |
| `preview_round` | int (px) | `12` | Window preview corner radius |
| `blur` | float `0`..`1` | `1.0` | Backdrop + strip blur strength (`0` = off; fractions allowed) |
| `switch_animation` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Slide the previews sideways when the displayed workspace changes (the outgoing set leaves as the incoming one arrives) |
| `switch_duration` | int (ms) | `260` | Length of that slide |
| `move_animation` | bool (0/1) | `1` | A window dropped on a workspace card keeps flying into it, shrinking into its slot; the card holds off drawing it until it lands |
| `move_duration` | int (ms) | `240` | Length of that flight |
| `anchor` | `top` \| `bottom` \| `left` \| `right` | `top` | Edge the workspace strip attaches to |
| `strip_offset` | int (px) | `0` | Inset from the anchored edge (0 = flush, no gap) |
| `strip_height` | int (px) | `150` | Strip band thickness, label included |
| `strip_margin` | int (px) | `22` | Padding around the strip |
| `strip_gap` | int (px) | `18` | Spacing between workspace cards |
| `strip_card_round` | int (px) | `10` | Workspace card corner radius |
| `backdrop_color` | color | `0x73070a10` | Dim + blur fill over the desktop |
| `strip_band_color` | color | `0x24ffffff` | Band behind the cards |
| `strip_card_color` | color | `0x3a0e131c` | Inactive workspace card fill |
| `strip_active_color` | color | `0x4d1c2c44` | Active workspace card fill |
| `strip_active_border` | color | `0xf0ffffff` | Active card border |
| `strip_active_border_size` | int (px) | `2` | Active card border thickness |
| `strip_hover_border` | color | `0x80ffffff` | Hovered card border |
| `strip_hover_border_size` | int (px) | `2` | Hovered card border thickness |
| `strip_plus_color` | color | `0xd0eef4ff` | The "+" glyph |
| `preview_bg` | color | `0xff14181f` | Opaque backing drawn under a preview's live surface |
| `shadow_color` | color | `0x70000000` | Window preview drop shadow |
| `hover_border` | color | `0xf0ffffff` | Hovered window preview border |
| `hover_border_size` | int (px) | `3` | Hovered preview border thickness |
| `select_border` | color | `0xf066ccff` | Keyboard-selected preview border |
| `select_border_size` | int (px) | `3` | Keyboard-selected preview border thickness |
| `focus_follows_mouse` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Keyboard selection tracks the hovered preview |
| `scroll_switches_workspace` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Wheel over the main area steps prev/next workspace |
| `passthrough_keys` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Let keys the overview doesn't use reach Hyprland (keybinds keep working) |
| `key_close` | key names | `escape` | Keys that dismiss |
| `key_next_workspace` | key names | `tab` | Cycle the displayed workspace forward (wraps); `""` to disable. Held modifiers match exactly, so e.g. a `SUPER+Tab` toggle bind still passes through and closes |
| `key_prev_workspace` | key names | `shift+tab` | Cycle the displayed workspace backward (`mod+key` combos supported: `shift`/`ctrl`/`alt`/`super`) |
| `key_activate` | key names | `enter` | Keys that focus the selected preview |
| `key_close_window` | key names | `d` | Keys that close the selected preview's window (overview stays open); `""` to disable |
| `key_left` / `key_right` / `key_up` / `key_down` | key names | `left` / `right` / `up` / `down` | Move the keyboard selection (e.g. set `h`/`l`/`k`/`j` for vim nav) |
| `key_desktop` | key names | `shift` | Flip canvas↔grid |
| `key_all_workspaces` | key names | `a` | Toggle the all-workspaces (expo) view; `""` to disable |
| `key_workspace` | key names | `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0` | Each key switches to the Nth strip card's workspace, for real (slot position = card index) |
| `exit_on_click` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Click on empty space dismisses the overview |
| `exit_on_switch` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Dismiss when the live workspace changes underneath (e.g. a keybind) |
| `show_all_workspaces` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Main area shows every window on the monitor (expo), not just the displayed workspace. Toggle live with `gloview:allworkspaces`, the `key_all_workspaces` key, or the strip's "All" card. Picking a preview here follows it: the overview closes onto that window's workspace |
| `show_empty` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Keep empty workspaces as strip cards. Has no effect while `dynamic_workspaces` is on (which it is by default) — set that to `0` to get the old always-list-everything strip back |
| `dynamic_workspaces` | bool (0/1) | `1` | GNOME/hyprnome-style workspaces: only populated workspaces are listed and the strip ends in one empty card (drawn as a workspace, not a `+`). Stepping onto it, clicking it (which also closes the overview onto the new desktop) or dropping a window into it creates it; the *next* empty card only appears once a window actually lands there, so you never see two blank desktops in a row, and emptying it again takes the extra card back away. Workspaces you empty drop off the strip. Forces `show_empty` off. Pair with `autodelete_empty` if you also want workspaces your config pins to be destroyed, not just hidden |
| `autodelete_empty` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Let Hyprland reap empty workspaces this monitor still pins. Hyprland already destroys unpinned empties on its own, so this only affects ones held by a `persistent:true` rule (and gloview's own abandoned trailing workspace) — the "empty ones get deleted automatically" half of GNOME-style workspaces. **Releasing a persistent workspace lasts until your next config reload — set this to `0` if you keep `persistent:true` workspaces you want left alone.** Skips the displayed workspace, anything visible on any monitor, workspaces holding any window (mapped or not), scratchpads, named workspaces, and other monitors' workspaces |
| `show_workspace_labels` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Workspace names above the strip cards. Off frees the label band, so the cards grow into it |
| `show_window_labels` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Window title pill under a hovered/selected preview |
| `show_special` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Include the special (scratchpad) workspace as a strip card |
| `strip_all_card` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Show a leading "All workspaces" card on the strip that toggles the expo view |
| `drag_to_swap` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Grid mode: dropping a preview onto another swaps the two windows' places |
| `switch_on_drop` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Dropping a window on a card also follows it to that workspace |
| `switch_on_new_workspace` | bool (0/1) | `1` | Clicking the plain `+` follows the display to the new workspace. (The trailing card `dynamic_workspaces` draws is a workspace card, not a `+`: clicking it always takes you there and closes the overview) |
| `close_button_color` | color | `0xe6e23b3b` | Desktop-mode `✕` close-button fill |
| `hide_top_layers` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Fade out Top layer surfaces (bars, e.g. Waybar) while open |
| `hide_overlay_layers` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Fade out Overlay layer surfaces (popups/notifications) while open |
| `above_namespaces` | string | `""` | Comma/space list of layer namespaces to draw *above* the overview (trailing `*` glob; a namespace containing `aboveoverview` always qualifies) |
| `debug_logs` | bool (0/1) | `0` | Verbose `[gloview]` logging |

`top`/`bottom` give a horizontal strip, `left`/`right` a vertical one. `anchor`
supersedes the older `bar_position` (top/bottom only); set `anchor` and it wins.
